# Speech Recognition Documentation for codes #
In this part of repository Codes for recognition of speeches are presented.
The seven engines operate speech recognition are as follows:

  * recognize_bing: Uses Microsoft's Bing Speech.
  * recognize_google: Uses Google's Web Speech API.
  * recognize_google_cloud: Uses Google's Cloud Speech. Using this method 
    would need google-cloud-speech to be installed, which can be easily
    installed through pip by running pip install google-cloud-speech.
  * recognize_houndify: Uses SoundHound's Houndify.
  * recognize_ibm: Uses IBM's speech to text.
  * recognize_sphinx: Uses CMU's Sphinx. This method has a dependency
    on PocketSphinx, which can be installed by running pip install pocketsphinx.
  * recognize_wit: Uses Wit.ai.
